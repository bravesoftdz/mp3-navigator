      <P>When Winamp introduced its plugin capabilities Kuo (Djohan) 
      Shiang-shiang's Lyrics Displayer was one of the first plugins, and 
      probably the first program that made a connection between MP3 audio and 
      lyrics. The lyrics displayed by Kuo's Lyrics Displayer were stored in 
      separate text files from which the program got it.</P>
      <P>Petr Strnad saw the problems in this so he decided to make a lyrics 
      tag, enabling the text to reside inside the audio file. This is done by 
      creating a chunk of data which begins with "LYRICSBEGIN", ends with 
      "LYRICSEND" and has the lyrics between these keywords. This data block is 
      then saved in the audio file between the audio and the ID3 tag. If no ID3 
      tag is present one must be attached.</P>
      <P>The following simple rules applies to the lyrics inserted between the 
      keywords:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>The keywords "LYRICSBEGIN" and "LYRICSEND" must not be present in 
        the lyrics. 
        <LI>The text is encoded with ISO-8859-1 character set 
        <LI>A byte in the text must not have the binary value 255. 
        <LI>The maximum length of the lyrics is 5100 bytes. 
        <LI>Newlines are made with CR+LF sequence.</LI></UL>
