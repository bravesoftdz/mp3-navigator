              <TR>
                <TD>M!ssundaztood - AMG Review<BR>Pink's debut album was a 
                  promising collection of dance-pop, easily lumped into the teen 
                  pop boon of 2000 since she was young and sang over savvy, 
                  skittering club beats. Those comparisons irked - hell, angered 
                  - Pink, and she was determined to prove she was real with her 
                  second album. So she called up her idol, Linda Perry of 4 Non 
                  Blondes fame, to help her rock and write; bared her soul; 
                  fought for some artistic control; brought in Steven Tyler; and 
                  wound up with M!ssundaztood, a title bound to never show up on 
                  Internet search engines. This all sounds like the script for a 
                  VH1 movie, but the wild thing is that M!ssundaztood not only 
                  works, it works smashingly - a bewildering amalgam of sounds 
                  and attitudes that shouldn't fit together, but defy all odds 
                  and do. This record bubbles over with imagination, as hooky 
                  pop songs like the title track rub shoulders with glitzy 
                  dancefloor anthems like "Get the Party Started" and sexy, 
                  swaggering arena rock redux like "18 Wheeler" before delving 
                  into weird confessionals like "Family Portrait," "Dear Diary," 
                  and "My Vietnam." Forget that this isn't what anybody would 
                  have expected Pink to do; it's hard to imagine anybody else 
                  that would have the idea and the inclination to blend 
                  late-'80s, metal-spiked album rock with modern hip-hop and 
                  dance, then dress it up with dazzling modern pop production, 
                  all the while not avoiding painful subjects (particularly her 
                  dysfunctional family) or melody. If that's not an artistic 
                  statement, I don't know what is, and the damn thing is there 
                  hasn't been a record in the mainstream this vibrant or this 
                  alive in a long, long time.<BR>Stephen Thomas Erlewine

                <TD>M!ssundaztood - AMG Review<BR>Pink's debut album was a 
                  promising collection of dance-pop, easily lumped into the teen 
                  pop boon of 2000 since she was young and sang over savvy, 
                  skittering club beats. Those comparisons irked - hell, angered 
                  - Pink, and she was determined to prove she was real with her 
                  second album. So she called up her idol, Linda Perry of 4 Non 
                  Blondes fame, to help her rock and write; bared her soul; 
                  fought for some artistic control; brought in Steven Tyler; and 
                  wound up with M!ssundaztood, a title bound to never show up on 
                  Internet search engines. This all sounds like the script for a 
                  VH1 movie, but the wild thing is that M!ssundaztood not only 
                  works, it works smashingly - a bewildering amalgam of sounds 
                  and attitudes that shouldn't fit together, but defy all odds 
                  and do. This record bubbles over with imagination, as hooky 
                  pop songs like the title track rub shoulders with glitzy 
                  dancefloor anthems like "Get the Party Started" and sexy, 
                  swaggering arena rock redux like "18 Wheeler" before delving 
                  into weird confessionals like "Family Portrait," "Dear Diary," 
                  and "My Vietnam." Forget that this isn't what anybody would 
                  have expected Pink to do; it's hard to imagine anybody else 
                  that would have the idea and the inclination to blend 
                  late-'80s, metal-spiked album rock with modern hip-hop and 
                  dance, then dress it up with dazzling modern pop production, 
                  all the while not avoiding painful subjects (particularly her 
                  dysfunctional family) or melody. If that's not an artistic 
                  statement, I don't know what is, and the damn thing is there 
                  hasn't been a record in the mainstream this vibrant or this 
                  alive in a long, long time.<BR>Stephen Thomas Erlewine

                <TD>M!ssundaztood - AMG Review<BR>Pink's debut album was a 
                  promising collection of dance-pop, easily lumped into the teen 
                  pop boon of 2000 since she was young and sang over savvy, 
                  skittering club beats. Those comparisons irked - hell, angered 
                  - Pink, and she was determined to prove she was real with her 
                  second album. So she called up her idol, Linda Perry of 4 Non 
                  Blondes fame, to help her rock and write; bared her soul; 
                  fought for some artistic control; brought in Steven Tyler; and 
                  wound up with M!ssundaztood, a title bound to never show up on 
                  Internet search engines. This all sounds like the script for a 
                  VH1 movie, but the wild thing is that M!ssundaztood not only 
                  works, it works smashingly - a bewildering amalgam of sounds 
                  and attitudes that shouldn't fit together, but defy all odds 
                  and do. This record bubbles over with imagination, as hooky 
                  pop songs like the title track rub shoulders with glitzy 
                  dancefloor anthems like "Get the Party Started" and sexy, 
                  swaggering arena rock redux like "18 Wheeler" before delving 
                  into weird confessionals like "Family Portrait," "Dear Diary," 
                  and "My Vietnam." Forget that this isn't what anybody would 
                  have expected Pink to do; it's hard to imagine anybody else 
                  that would have the idea and the inclination to blend 
                  late-'80s, metal-spiked album rock with modern hip-hop and 
                  dance, then dress it up with dazzling modern pop production, 
                  all the while not avoiding painful subjects (particularly her 
                  dysfunctional family) or melody. If that's not an artistic 
                  statement, I don't know what is, and the damn thing is there 
                  hasn't been a record in the mainstream this vibrant or this 
                  alive in a long, long time.<BR>Stephen Thomas Erlewine

                <TD>M!ssundaztood - AMG Review<BR>Pink's debut album was a 
                  promising collection of dance-pop, easily lumped into the teen 
                  pop boon of 2000 since she was young and sang over savvy, 
                  skittering club beats. Those comparisons irked - hell, angered 
                  - Pink, and she was determined to prove she was real with her 
                  second album. So she called up her idol, Linda Perry of 4 Non 
                  Blondes fame, to help her rock and write; bared her soul; 
                  fought for some artistic control; brought in Steven Tyler; and 
                  wound up with M!ssundaztood, a title bound to never show up on 
                  Internet search engines. This all sounds like the script for a 
                  VH1 movie, but the wild thing is that M!ssundaztood not only 
                  works, it works smashingly - a bewildering amalgam of sounds 
                  and attitudes that shouldn't fit together, but defy all odds 
                  and do. This record bubbles over with imagination, as hooky 
                  pop songs like the title track rub shoulders with glitzy 
                  dancefloor anthems like "Get the Party Started" and sexy, 
                  swaggering arena rock redux like "18 Wheeler" before delving 
                  into weird confessionals like "Family Portrait," "Dear Diary," 
                  and "My Vietnam." Forget that this isn't what anybody would 
                  have expected Pink to do; it's hard to imagine anybody else 
                  that would have the idea and the inclination to blend 
                  late-'80s, metal-spiked album rock with modern hip-hop and 
                  dance, then dress it up with dazzling modern pop production, 
                  all the while not avoiding painful subjects (particularly her 
                  dysfunctional family) or melody. If that's not an artistic 
                  statement, I don't know what is, and the damn thing is there 
                  hasn't been a record in the mainstream this vibrant or this 
                  alive in a long, long time.<BR>Stephen Thomas Erlewine

                <TD>M!ssundaztood - AMG Review<BR>Pink's debut album was a 
                  promising collection of dance-pop, easily lumped into the teen 
                  pop boon of 2000 since she was young and sang over savvy, 
                  skittering club beats. Those comparisons irked - hell, angered 
                  - Pink, and she was determined to prove she was real with her 
                  second album. So she called up her idol, Linda Perry of 4 Non 
                  Blondes fame, to help her rock and write; bared her soul; 
                  fought for some artistic control; brought in Steven Tyler; and 
                  wound up with M!ssundaztood, a title bound to never show up on 
                  Internet search engines. This all sounds like the script for a 
                  VH1 movie, but the wild thing is that M!ssundaztood not only 
                  works, it works smashingly - a bewildering amalgam of sounds 
                  and attitudes that shouldn't fit together, but defy all odds 
                  and do. This record bubbles over with imagination, as hooky 
                  pop songs like the title track rub shoulders with glitzy 
                  dancefloor anthems like "Get the Party Started" and sexy, 
                  swaggering arena rock redux like "18 Wheeler" before delving 
                  into weird confessionals like "Family Portrait," "Dear Diary," 
                  and "My Vietnam." Forget that this isn't what anybody would 
                  have expected Pink to do; it's hard to imagine anybody else 
                  that would have the idea and the inclination to blend 
                  late-'80s, metal-spiked album rock with modern hip-hop and 
                  dance, then dress it up with dazzling modern pop production, 
                  all the while not avoiding painful subjects (particularly her 
                  dysfunctional family) or melody. If that's not an artistic 
                  statement, I don't know what is, and the damn thing is there 
                  hasn't been a record in the mainstream this vibrant or this 
                  alive in a long, long time.<BR>Stephen Thomas Erlewine

                  opportunity and I knock so softly<BR>Sometimes I get loud when 
                  I wish everybody'd just<BR>get off me<BR>So many playas you'd 
                  think I was a ball game<BR>Its every man for themself, there 
                  are no<BR>team mates<BR>This life gets lonely when everybody 
                  wants<BR>something<BR>This might have been your fate<BR>But 
                  they'll get their's eventually<BR>And I hope I'm 
                  there<BR><BR>Surrounded by familiar faces without 
                  names<BR>None of them know me or want to share my pain<BR>And 
                  they only wish to bask in my light, then fade<BR>away<BR>To 
                  win my love, to them a game<BR>To watch me live my life in 
                  pain<BR>When all is done and the glitter fades, 
                  fades<BR>away<BR>They'll get their's eventually<BR>And I hope 
                  I'm there<BR><BR>I drank your poison cuz you told me its 
                  wine<BR>Shame on you if you fool once<BR>Shame on me if you 
                  fool me twice<BR>I didn't know the price<BR>You'll get yours 
                  eventually<BR><BR>So what good am I to you if I can't be 
                  broken?<BR>You'll get yours, yes you'll get 
                  yours<BR>Eventually

                <TD>M!ssundaztood - AMG Review<BR>Pink's debut album was a 
                  promising collection of dance-pop, easily lumped into the teen 
                  pop boon of 2000 since she was young and sang over savvy, 
                  skittering club beats. Those comparisons irked - hell, angered 
                  - Pink, and she was determined to prove she was real with her 
                  second album. So she called up her idol, Linda Perry of 4 Non 
                  Blondes fame, to help her rock and write; bared her soul; 
                  fought for some artistic control; brought in Steven Tyler; and 
                  wound up with M!ssundaztood, a title bound to never show up on 
                  Internet search engines. This all sounds like the script for a 
                  VH1 movie, but the wild thing is that M!ssundaztood not only 
                  works, it works smashingly - a bewildering amalgam of sounds 
                  and attitudes that shouldn't fit together, but defy all odds 
                  and do. This record bubbles over with imagination, as hooky 
                  pop songs like the title track rub shoulders with glitzy 
                  dancefloor anthems like "Get the Party Started" and sexy, 
                  swaggering arena rock redux like "18 Wheeler" before delving 
                  into weird confessionals like "Family Portrait," "Dear Diary," 
                  and "My Vietnam." Forget that this isn't what anybody would 
                  have expected Pink to do; it's hard to imagine anybody else 
                  that would have the idea and the inclination to blend 
                  late-'80s, metal-spiked album rock with modern hip-hop and 
                  dance, then dress it up with dazzling modern pop production, 
                  all the while not avoiding painful subjects (particularly her 
                  dysfunctional family) or melody. If that's not an artistic 
                  statement, I don't know what is, and the damn thing is there 
                  hasn't been a record in the mainstream this vibrant or this 
                  alive in a long, long time.<BR>Stephen Thomas Erlewine

                <TD>M!ssundaztood - AMG Review<BR>Pink's debut album was a 
                  promising collection of dance-pop, easily lumped into the teen 
                  pop boon of 2000 since she was young and sang over savvy, 
                  skittering club beats. Those comparisons irked - hell, angered 
                  - Pink, and she was determined to prove she was real with her 
                  second album. So she called up her idol, Linda Perry of 4 Non 
                  Blondes fame, to help her rock and write; bared her soul; 
                  fought for some artistic control; brought in Steven Tyler; and 
                  wound up with M!ssundaztood, a title bound to never show up on 
                  Internet search engines. This all sounds like the script for a 
                  VH1 movie, but the wild thing is that M!ssundaztood not only 
                  works, it works smashingly - a bewildering amalgam of sounds 
                  and attitudes that shouldn't fit together, but defy all odds 
                  and do. This record bubbles over with imagination, as hooky 
                  pop songs like the title track rub shoulders with glitzy 
                  dancefloor anthems like "Get the Party Started" and sexy, 
                  swaggering arena rock redux like "18 Wheeler" before delving 
                  into weird confessionals like "Family Portrait," "Dear Diary," 
                  and "My Vietnam." Forget that this isn't what anybody would 
                  have expected Pink to do; it's hard to imagine anybody else 
                  that would have the idea and the inclination to blend 
                  late-'80s, metal-spiked album rock with modern hip-hop and 
                  dance, then dress it up with dazzling modern pop production, 
                  all the while not avoiding painful subjects (particularly her 
                  dysfunctional family) or melody. If that's not an artistic 
                  statement, I don't know what is, and the damn thing is there 
                  hasn't been a record in the mainstream this vibrant or this 
                  alive in a long, long time.<BR>Stephen Thomas Erlewine
